# jQuery.popcorntime_remote
Popcorntime_remote is a jQuery plugin that provides an easy way to make an application or whatever you want to control the interface of [popcorn time](https://popcorntime.io/) through the json rpc protocol.<br>
The plugin is developed with simplicity in mind so, for example, the methods name are the same that you can find in the [popcorn time documention](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/desktop/blob/master/docs/json-rpc-api.md) and there are many other conveniences.

##Download
You can get the plugin in different ways:

1. Downloading the raw file in the dist folder choosing the [clean]() or [minified]() version.
2. If you want to take a look to the demo, you can directly [download the repo](https://github.com/giacomocerquone/jQuery.popcorntime_remote/archive/master.zip).
3. Go to the releases tab and download the [Source code.zip]()

##Include and Initialize
First include jQuery and after this plugin on the page you want to use it:
```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="jQuery.popcorntime_remote.min.js"></script>
```
After initialize the plugin in this way:
```javascript
var init = new $.popcorntime_remote(
//If you don't need to change these settings you can remove this whole part
  {
    username: "popcorn",
    password: "popcorn",
    ip: "127.0.0.1",
    port: "8008",
    debug: "false"
  }
//If you don't need to change these settings you can remove this whole part
);
```
From now on you'll call every method in this form:
```javascript
init.nameofthemethod(["array_of_string_params_if_needed"]);
```
Pretty simple uh?

##Usage
First of all let's initialize this plugin:


As you can understand from the popcorn time documentation, there are "three kinds" of methods.

1. Methods which performs actions without any parameter needed.<br>
  These are {listing methods}:<br>
  ```javascript
  init.ping();
  ```
2. Methods which performs actions with parameters that are necessary.<br>
  These are {listing methods}:<br>
  ```javascript
  init.filtergenres(["Action"]);
  ```
3. Methods which performs actions and return some datas.


If you don't know if parameters are needed or what you have to pass to the methods and for every other information, as I already said, you can look at the [popcorn time documentation](https://git.popcorntime.io/popcorntime/desktop/blob/master/docs/json-rpc-api.md). Despite that doc has been written with the json rpc protocol in mind, the information about the usage of the methods are compatible for this library too... actually you will not even notice that you're using this library.
